# Classification: MAGIC Gamma Telescope
• It is used to find the "cosmic source" by registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using imaging technique.

• I tested all the classification algorithms and finally got the best results by using **"Random Forest Classification"**. And then distinguished gamma rays (signal) from hadronic showers (background) for the further studies.
