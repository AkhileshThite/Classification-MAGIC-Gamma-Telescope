# MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope
• It is used to find the "cosmic source" by registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using imaging technique.

• I've tested all the classification algorithms and finally got the best results using Random Forest Classification, and distinguished gamma rays (signal) from hadronic showers (background) for the further studies.
